## 👩‍💻 About Me
Hi! I'm a full stack developer who loves building complete, meaningful systems – from sleek frontends to powerful APIs.  
I care about **clean architecture**, **smart design**, and code that’s both elegant and practical.

Whether it’s React + TypeScript on the front, or C# Web API / Node.js on the back – I’m at home.  
My journey is hands-on, project-based, and focused on creating real impact.
